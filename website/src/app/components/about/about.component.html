          <p class="textContent slide-right">Frame, established in 2005, was the vision of an enthusiastic civil engineer. Frame was launched as an engineering firm that is concerned with advanced technologies to achieve the clientâ€™s satisfaction and to fulfill technical requirements.
            
            In 2010, Frame for Aluminum Works and Glass Facades eagerly entered the Egyptian Market to deal with most of the class-A developers and contractors.  Frame was consistent in hitting productivity and commitment records in all the deliverable aspects.
            
            In 2016, Frame increased its manufacturing space to 3000 m2, to cope with the customers' needs. In 2020, Frame acquired the most advanced German machines to implement accurate cutting and assembly of the products.
            
            Up to 2020 and onwards, Frame had covered a diverse group of residential, commercial, industrial, recreational, and touristic projects.
